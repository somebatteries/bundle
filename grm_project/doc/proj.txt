INTRODUCTION                                    *proj-intro*

This plugin provides functionality to navigate across multiple project
spaces.  It will manage changing the ctags path, grep directories,
working directories etc.

COMMANDS                                        *:proj*

Use the |:proj| command with no arguments to open a buffer containing a
list of all known projects.

The optional *pattern* argument can be supplied to display a list of all
known projects whose project name matches the pattern.  If only one 
match is detected, that project will be opened instantly.

    Example: >
        :proj GIA.*W
<   This lists all GIA projects which end in the letter, "W" 
    If only one project existed, it would be opened right away.
